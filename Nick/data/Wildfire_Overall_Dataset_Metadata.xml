      <abstract>This dataset is comprised of four different zip files. 

Zip File 1: A combined wildfire polygon dataset ranging in years from 1878-2019 (142 years) that was created by merging and dissolving fire information from 12 different original wildfire datasets to create one of the most comprehensive wildfire datasets available. Attributes describing fires that were reported in the various source data, including fire name, fire code, ignition date, controlled date, containment date, and fire cause, were included in this product’s attribute table.

Zip Files 2-4: The fire polygons were turned into 30 meter rasters with the values representing area burned in each year (128 yearly rasters total, as some years in the 1800s had no fires recorded). Three rasters were calculated from the yearly rasters: (a) their yearly values were turned to 1 and these values were summed to create a count of the number of times burned, (b) the first time a pixel burned was selected to create a first year burned raster, and (c) the last time a pixel burned was selected to create a most recent year burned raster. These calculations were done for the contiguous US, Alaska, and Hawaii separately in order to reduce file size and download time. Each of the zipped files contains the three rasters for one of the following  locations: contiguous US, Alaska, and Hawaii.</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset was designed to create a comprehensive burned area feature class and summary rasters with a known time component for use as a visualization tool and in multiple analyses.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This data release includes the most up to date wildfire information through 2019. We anticipate, but cannot guarantee that this wildfire dataset will be updated yearly as new wildfire information becomes available.</supplinf>

  <dataqual>
    <attracc>
      <attraccr>These datasets were obtained from 12 different wildfire datasets, each with their own limitations in accuracy in both time and space. We are relying on the original dataset attributes for accuracy. We cannot know, for example, whether the fire occurred in the year stated in the attributes or whether it was a different year. Whether derived by satellite imagery, created through the use of GPS points, or hand drawn on a topographic map, no wildfire perimeter is 100% accurate. In addition, not all fires were reported, especially older fires; thus one or two fires reported per year in the late 1800s almost certainly underestimates the actual number of fires. We intended to merge and dissolve different polygons that represent the same fire in different source datasets to create a single boundary for the wildfire. However, this dissolving process can result in the fire polygon with the least amount of detail contributing the most to the boundary of one fire. Instead of dissolving all fire polygons together regardless of dataset quality, our system broke the fires into 3 Tiers that were processed individually. Tier 1 contained polygons only from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset. Tier 2 contained a combination of state and federal wildfire layers. Tier 3 contained polygons from the Land Treatment Digital Library. By processing this data set in a tiered fashion (1-3) we hoped to improve accuracy of the polygons as each subsequent tier had fire polygons that intersected in space and fire year from the previous tiers removed before being processed. The goal was to improve the accuracy of the wildfire polygon. Whether this worsens or improves the actual fire boundary is unknown, because, as we stated before, no fire polygon is 100% accurate to begin with.  The raster boundaries should be assumed to be the approximate area burned. These rasters represent the first year burned, most recent year burned, and the count of wildfires based on the data in the dataset itself. It is impossible know how many fires were missed or mapped improperly.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>This dataset was designed to eliminate duplicate wildfire boundaries. All internal checks suggest we have merged the fire data correctly. Year ranges fall within expected ranges as do wildfire dates. We cannot say with 100% confidence that all boundaries within this dataset are wildfires. We included fires where the fire type is unknown. This could introduce prescribed fires. Examples where prescribed fires are likely to have been introduced in high quantities include eastern Kansas as well as the southeast coast down into Florida. However, we decided to err on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion. Users will have to have knowledge of their local area when determining whether this dataset accurately represents the area burned in wildfires. Summary raster layers were checked to ensure that they match up to the polygon values to which they correspond. While we know the fire year of major fires is correct, there are thousands of smaller fires for which no record exists other than their inclusion in one of the original datasets. It is impossible for us to confirm all fire years in this dataset are accurate.</logic>
    <complete>We did our best to remove all wildfires without a Year Burned attribute and any non-wildfire burned areas (prescribed fires). However, we are relatively certain that some prescribed fires made it into the dataset. While we do not know the exact number, it is likely a very small percentage based on the steps we took to remove prescribed fires. We assumed that an area of land could not burn more than once in the same year. While extremely rare, burning twice in one year has been known to occur. However, even if an area did burn twice in the same year, for our purposes, we counted this as one burn. We assumed any fires that burned in the same year within 1km of each other were the same fire. This may not always be the case. While we would not lose the fire boundary itself, the fire attributes of these neighboring fires will be merged in to one record. Both of these assumptions will lower the count of actual fires, but should not affect the acreage. We assumed that anything marked as "Unknown" for fire type in the initial datasets was a wildfire. However, certain unknown fires tend to occur in areas that are frequently burned in prescribed fires (eastern Kansas and the southeast coast). We cannot unilaterally decide that certain unknown fires are prescribed burns while other unknown fires are wildfires. We decided to err on the side of including these fires rather than excluding them as the area still burned even if it was a prescribed fire. While we admit that a few fires in the dataset are undoubtedly prescribed fires, every effort was made to remove as many prescribed fires as possible. We also identified other fire datasets such as the Western Fire Map (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/544ab5aae4b03653c63f8a75) and the Western North America Fires Map (https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/542d837ae4b092f17defc66e) for possible inclusion in this dataset. These were previous publications to do what we are currently doing. We discovered these datasets intentionally contained hundreds of prescribed fire polygons and had thousands of wildfire polygons that had identical boundaries to our current dataset, but had fire years that were off by 1-3 years. After consulting with the original authors, it was determined that the best course of action was to exclude these layers from our current effort.</complete>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Please see specific datasets for detailed step by step information. Original data were downloaded, cleaned, and edited to include a common set of fire attributes. These fires were merged and dissolved in a specific order to create one fire polygon per area and year. Attributes from the original fire datasets were associated with these new combined, dissolved polygons. Once the master, combined polygon dataset was completed, the polygons were converted to 30m resolution rasters based on the year they burned. This process created 256 rasters, two for each year a fire was recorded (1878-2019). Some years in the late 1800s did not have a fire recorded. One raster per year had the pixel value of the year when a fire burned (Year Raster). For the second raster in the year, we used the ArcGIS Con tool to convert the year value to 1 (Count Raster). Using ArcGIS Cell Statistics we performed three different calculations. Count Rasters were summed to calculate the number of times each pixel burned. Year Rasters were run through the First and Last perimeters to calculate the most recent year each pixel burned. These 3 raster datasets were published along with the polygon dataset.</procdesc>
