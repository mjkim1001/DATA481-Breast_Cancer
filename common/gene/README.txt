File Descriptions

[data766_breast_cancer_gene_expression.csv]

Measurements of the quantity of RNA (aka gene expression) for all genes in the human genome.
Columns are breast cancer samples. Rows are Ensembl gene IDs.

[data766_breast_cancer_metadata.csv]

Metadata associated with samples (columns) from the gene expression matrix.
mRNA 			- sample ID
PAM50 			- Genetic Subtype
TumorPurity 		- Lower values correspond to higher non-tumor contamination
ProliferationScore 	- Gene based score assessing aggressiveness of tumor
ER 			- Clinical assessment of estrogen receptor status
PR 			- Clinical assessment of progesterone receptor status
HER2 			- Clinical assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor status

[gene_mappings.csv]

Maps ensembl gene ids (rows) to gene symbols (i.e. common name) and to the type of gene.
